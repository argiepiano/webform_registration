# ![Webform Registration](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/webform_registration/blob/1.x-1.x/images/webform_registration.png "Webform Registration for BackdropCMS")

This module adds a "Registration Settings" option under the "Webform" tab, 
allowing you to create a user account for someone who fills out a webform.
The only required field on the webform is the email address, but you can
also set up fields for username and password, as well as any other webform
fields that you need to collect.

You have the option to set the status of the new user (active or blocked), 
assign roles to the new account and provide an "opt in" option so that the 
webform only creates a new user if the person filling the form specifically 
requests it.
